    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I have always had a fascination with Sweden. Perhaps it is due to my deep interest in Vikings and their culture? Or it could be the fact that according to my MyHeritage.com DNA results I am apparently <strong>25.9%</strong> Scandinavian?</p>
    <p>Regardless of this, what inspired me to first attempt to make these delicious buns was after watch my partner and I's favourite anime, One Piece, and seeing Big Mom's obesession with them</p>
    <p>They are traditionally supposed to be eating during February before Lent and apparently a Swedish <em>actually died from eating too many of them in one sitting (apparently 12!)</em></p>

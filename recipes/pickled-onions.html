    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Have you ever gone to a restaurant, seen pickled onions on a dish you ordered and thought, "Wow these are delicious! They seem quite fancy though, probably difficult to make myself".</p>
    <p> Well you are in luck! Pickled onions are <strong>unbelievably easy</strong> to make and add a nice tang to any dish, elevating it to <em>restaurant-quality</em> instantly!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Makes 1 Jar</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium red onions, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>250ml white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>200ml boiled water</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp peppercorns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the sliced onions into a jar.</li>
        <li>Add the boiled water and vinegar to a heatproof measuring cup and mix well.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Alternatively you can boil this mixture in a pan.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mix in the sugar and salt into the water-vinegar mixture and stir until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the peppercorns to the jar with the onions.</li>
        <li>Pour the water-vinegar mixture over the onions making sure the onions are completely submerged.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and give the jar a good shake so that everything is thoroughly mixed.</li>
        <li>Leave the jar to sit for at least 15 minutes. Once it reaches room temperature, I recommend putting the jar in the fridge overnight to allow the onions to infuse.</li>
        <li>Use the onions as a garnish and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

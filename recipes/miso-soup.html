    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My partner is Japanese. Throughout my time with her <em>(almost 6 years now!)</em> I have learnt a lot about Japanese cuisine. One of my favourite dishes that has now become my daily breaksfast is a simple dish that provides great nutrition and tastes delicious, <strong>Miso Soup.</strong></p>
    <p>Now when you first hear the term, you probably think of a simple soup that you might order at a typical Japanese restautant that is mostly just liquid with a few chopped spring onions and maybe even small cubes of tofu. However, I have learnt that Miso Soup can include <strong>so much more.</strong></p>
    <p>This version contains lots of different vegetable: carrots, onions, daikon (white turnip), napa cabbage and potatoes. I hope that you enjoy it as much as we do!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Makes 8 Servings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium sized carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium sized potatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>Half of 1 napa cabbage, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium brown onions, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>4cm of daikon, peeled and cut into small triangles</li>
        <li>10g of instant dashi powder</li>
        <li>7 tbsp miso paste (red for a stronger flavour, white for a milder favour)</li>
        <li>1.5 litres of boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and prepare all vegetables and add to a wok or large pan with a drizzle of oil on a medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Sweat down the vegetables until they are slightly wilted, around 5-10 minutes.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> You can use a lid if you have one to help speed up this process.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the half cooked vegetables into a separate pot that can hold at least 2 litres of liquid.</li>
        <li>Add the boiling water and instant dashi powder to the pot.</li>
        <li>Set the heat to high, bring to a boil and mix to incorporate the dashi and allow it to dissolve.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer for around 10 minutes or until vegetables are cooked through.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> An easy way to check this is to take a knife and poke a carrot. If the knife goes through easily, it's ready!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>While the pot is simmering, add the miso paste to a heatproof bowl and take one ladleful of the pot liquid and add it to the bowl. Whisk until there are no lumps.</li>
        <li>Once vegetables are cooked through, turn off the heat and then add the miso paste into the pot, mixing thoroughly to incoporate.</li>
        <li>Serve into bowls and enjoy! We like to have this with a small bowl of rice and a half cooked egg. We also add some Cayenne Pepper to the soup to give it some kick!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My partner is Japanese. Throughout my time with her <em>(almost 6 years now!)</em> I have learnt a lot about Japanese cuisine. One of my favourite dishes that has now become my daily breaksfast is a simple dish that provides great nutrition and tastes delicious, <strong>Miso Soup.</strong></p>
    <p>Now when you first hear the term, you probably think of a simple soup that you might order at a typical Japanese restautant that is mostly just liquid with a few chopped spting onions and maybe even small cubes of tofu. However, I have learnt that Miso Soup can include so much more.</p>
    <p>This version contains lots of different vegetable: carrots, onions, daikon (white turnip), cabbage and potatoes.</p>
